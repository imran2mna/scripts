YAML definitions for scheduling

Kubernetes Master
===============

1. API server
2. Scheduler
3. Controller
4. etcd - distributed key-value database, central cluster db

*** We may have multiple masters.


Kubernetes Node
==============

1. kube-proxy (network)
2. dockerd
3. kubelet (agent - reporting health,metrics)
4. fluentd (log management) 

Both dockerd and kubelet are packaged into "Supervisord"


 - Homogenous Pods
 - Hetrogenous Pods

Kubernetes Pod
==============

Group of one or more containers that are always co-located, co-scheduled, and run in a shared context.
Containers in the same pod have the same hostname
Each pod is isolated by 
	- process ID (PID) namespace
	- Network namespace
	- Interprocess Communication (IPC) namespace
	- Unix Time Sharing (UTS) namespace

Which is an alternative to a 'VM with multiple processes'

************************************************
In docker, single unit of deployment: container
In kubernetes, single unit of deployment: pod

Labels & Selectors
==================

Key/Value pairs associated with Kubernetes objects.
Used to organize and select subsets of objects.
Attached to objects at creation time but modified at any time.
Labels are the essential glue to associate one API object with other.
	- Replication Controller -> Pods
	- Service -> Pods
	- Pods -> Nodes (eg: database on selected node only)

Services
========

An abstraction to define a logical set of Pods bound by a policy by to access them.
Services are exposed through internal and external endpoints.
Services can also point to non-Kubernetes endpoints through a Virtual-IP-Bridge.
Supports TCP and UDP.
Interfaces with kube-proxy to manipulate iptables.
Service can be exposed internal or external to the cluster.
